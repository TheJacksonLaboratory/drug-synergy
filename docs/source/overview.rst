**Overview**
============

In silico detection of transcriptional regulation genes from single cell transcriptomics.

**Description of the package functionality**
--------------------------------------------

Single cell expression datasets in the correct :ref:`input-data` are required as input. 
Normalized single cell transcriptomics datasets are then processed and principle steps: preparing cases, analyzing cases, and analyzing combinations are performed.
An analysis report along with :ref:`output-data` directories and files are generated at the conclusion of the pipeline. For a more in-depth summary, reference the figure below.
