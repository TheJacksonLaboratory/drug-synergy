**Overview**
============

This documentation describes Augmented Cancer Drug Atlas (ACDA) drug synergy prediction methods. We augmented the drug synergy prediction modeling approach CDA described in Narayan et al. by applying a Random Forest Regression and optimization via cross-validation hyperparameter tuning. For ease of sharing and use we implemented it as a python package. The source code is located at https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/drug-synergy.


**Description of the package functionality**
--------------------------------------------

This documentation shows what data inputs are necessary and how to use the ACDA API (Application Programming Interface) to generate the synergy predictions and the corresponding visualizations.
